<p>
        As of interests, I am interested in the world of business and how businesses are operated. Learning about what goes into a business and how it could operate to the best of it's ability is very interesting to me (hence why I am majoring in Business Economics). I am also interested into the world of streaming, as some <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/"> <strong>Twitch streamers</strong></a> like <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/sanchovies"> <strong>Sanchovies</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/nickich"> <strong>Nickich</strong></a> are some that truely inspire me to want to stream, or to be integrated into. As of hobbies, I like to listen to music, play video games, swim, workout with the intent to body-build, take walks, and to sleep.
